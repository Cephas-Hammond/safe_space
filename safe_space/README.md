A mobile app created using flutter for determining proximity between a user device and surrounding devices using Bluetooth.

## How it works

Immediately the app launches it starts scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices. The app works on Bluetooth and will therefore not perform its function if the Bluetooth is not activated on the user's device.

Users have the ability to select the type of notification they prefer.
